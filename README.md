# Blood-DB: Blood Donation Management Portal

Blood-DB is a web-based application that serves as a Blood Donation Management Portal. It allows individuals and organizations to participate in the blood donation process efficiently. The portal provides two types of logins: Person and Organization. Individuals can donate blood or send/receive blood requests, while organizations can host donation camps, manage donor data, and track the amount of blood collected during each camp.
